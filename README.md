# GreedyDataService
*A datastore solution that simplifies the player data management workflow*

# About
GreedyDataService is a simple module that allows you to easily edit player data from any server scope without any substantial datastore cooldowns (this is thanks to [boatbomber's HeatUp module](https://github.com/boatbomber/HeatUp)).

Highlighted features:
* Simplicity; ability to easily get and edit user data, even if they are not in the server
* Almost no cooldown; your saving limits are bound to MemoryService, not DataStoreService
* Scalability; use in both your personal and professional projects
* Automation for leaderstats; it can easily create leaderstat values for you, and updating the leaderstats value objects will thus update the values internally and still save (for those who use this workflow!)
* Readability; the API is readable and easily understandable, allowing the developer(s) to quickly adjust to it
* Session locking; prevent those pesky data exploits/bugs!

### So, why should I use this over other data solutions?
I want to emphasize the ease of use for this resource. It's simplicity is unrivaled, you will not find an easier data management system.

Many data management modules require more setup, meaning *you* become the one responsibile for managing datastore limits, setup structure, sanity checking, etc. With GreedyDataService, all of that friction is lifted; simply intialize a player's data session with one line of code, which, if you want, also manages the public leaderstats values you see in the player list.

I made this resource because it feels like a huge waste of time setting up data management code with other resources. This module satisfies my needs and speeds up development!

### Example script
```lua
local playersService = game:GetService("Players")

local greedyDataService = require(script.Parent.GreedyDataService)

local function playerAdded(player : Player)
	local leaderstatsSession = greedyDataService:loadPlayer(player)

	leaderstatsSession.data.Money = 1000 -- Sets "Money" to 1000
	leaderstatsSession:set("XP", 500) -- Sets "XP" to 500
	-- leaderstatsSession.data.whatever = value is the
	-- same as leaderstatsSession:set("whatever", value)

	-- For the rest of this, instead of using methods, I'll index .data

	leaderstatsSession.data("Joins", function(lastNumberOfJoins)
		return lastNumberOfJoins + 1
	end) -- Increments "Joins" by 1

	-- You can also do leaderstatsSession.data.Joins += 1

	if leaderstatsSession.data.Status == "new" then
		-- If a player is new, then say they are a rookie
		leaderstatsSession.data.Status = "rookie"

	elseif leaderstatsSession.data.Joins > 10 then
		-- If they joined more than 10 times, they are a visitor!
		leaderstatsSession.data.Status = "visitor"

	elseif leaderstatsSession.data.Joins > 100 then
		-- Wow, over 100 visits! They are now a regular.
		leaderstatsSession.data.Status = "regular"
	end

	print(leaderstatsSession:get("Status"))
	-- Prints "rookie", "visitor", or "regular"

	print(leaderstatsSession.data.Status)
	-- Should print the same thing again!

	table.insert(leaderstatsSession.data.Inventory, `DailyReward#{leaderstatsSession.data.Joins}`) -- Add something to a table
	print(leaderstatsSession.data.Inventory) -- Will get bigger every time you join!
end

for _, player in playersService:GetPlayers() do
	playerAdded(player)
end

playersService.PlayerAdded:Connect(playerAdded)
```

> ‚òùÔ∏è Key takeaway: `local leaderstatsSession = greedyDataService:loadPlayer(player)` was the only line of code needed to load and initialize the data.
