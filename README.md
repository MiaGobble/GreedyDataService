# About
GreedyDataService is a simple module that allows you to easily edit player data from any server scope without any substantial datastore cooldowns (this is thanks to [boatbomber's HeatUp module](https://github.com/boatbomber/HeatUp)).

Highlighted features:
* Simplicity; ability to easily get and edit user data, even if they are not in the server
* Almost no cooldown; your saving limits are bound to MemoryService, not DataStoreService
* Scalability; use in both your personal and professional projects
* Automation for leaderstats; it can easily create leaderstat values for you, and updating the leaderstats value objects will thus update the values internally and still save (for those who use this workflow!)
* Readability; the API is readable and easily understandable, allowing the developer(s) to quickly adjust to it
